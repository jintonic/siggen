This is the source code of the Majorana Demonstrator / MaGe signal simulation software.
It was most recently re-written by David C. Radford in Nov/Dec 2014.
Earlier versions of the fieldgen code were called m3dcr/ppc8 and ppc9, also by DCR
Earlier versions of the siggen code were by I-Yang Lee (in fortran), Karin Lagergren, and DCR.


These codes are for unsegmented, cylindrically symmetric point-contact detectors.

mjd_fieldgen:
    This code calculates the electric potential and weighting potential in
    the detector and writes them to files as specified in the configuration file.
    If you tell it to calculate the weight potential, it will also calculate
    the detector capacitance.
    It properly identifies and handles undepleted regions of the detector,
    including their effect on the weighting potential and capacitance.
    This is a stand-alone code and should not need any additional interface.

mjd_siggen (and signal_tester):
    This can be considered a library rather then a stand-alone program, although
    signal_tester serves as a test/demonstration program as well as a template for
    how to use the package. You can write your own interface or input/output code
    to compile with the siggen modules. 
    The siggen modules compile cleanly under both gcc and g++, so you can call them
    from C++ code without writing a separate wrapper.

A single configuration file is used to control the behavior of both the
fieldgen and siggen codes. A well-commented example can be found inside the
config_files directory.

There is a simple Makefile to compile mjd_fieldgen and signal_tester.
