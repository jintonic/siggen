8 Dec 2014 - added capacitance calculation following WP calculation
           - added proper handling of undepleted voxels in WP calculation
	   - can now calculate realistic signals without full depletion


TO DO:

- measure cpu time and try to optimize 
    - lots of redundant operations in efield_exists()
    - if vel << grid size, calculate dq/dt, number of steps?
    - can we combine calls grid_weights?
    	  - ipt and w in setup? also rlen, zlen, etc?

- add charge_size_slope, li_thickness, bulletization, etc

- mjd_fieldgen: add partial voxel-filling for outer contact and ditch?
